Augmented Reality based wardrobe to help you choose what to buy to pair with that cute T-shirt you won at the last hackathon

## Why?

I have a poor taste in fashion, specifically in selecting clothes (my mom doesn't agree with this though). I can't decide what would go with my bright yellow polka dot t-shirt. I need to wear everything and check in the mirror to see if it looks good on me.

Now you would say that I should take help of my girlfriend or my friends. 
1. I don't have a girlfriend.
2. I don't have friends with good fashion sense either.

## What to do now?
Why can't I take all of my wardrobe with me on shopping and try each one of them with the new clothes I want to buy? It would be what they call a logistic nightmare, right?

Not with w**AR**drobe, with AR in the middle. I just need to store my wardrobe digitally on the app, and try out all of those using Augmented Reality.

Sounds futuristic, doesn't it?

Not really. We are *this* close to achieving this reality and with data and some machine learning, your AR wardrobe will even start recommending clothes to you.
